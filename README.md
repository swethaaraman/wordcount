How it works:
-------------
This code gets the file as input and reads it. The file is then converted into a list. All the punctuations are removed and all the letters are converted to lowercase. This program uses dictionary to get the values of each key and adds 1 to it if the word is being repeated or adds 0 when it's not. the list that contsind the wordcount is then sorted from least to the most number of times the word occured.
